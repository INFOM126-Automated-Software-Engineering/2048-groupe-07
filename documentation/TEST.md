# 🧪 Test
## 🎄Overview
This documentation provides an overview of the testing process for the 2048 project. It explains what tests are, why they are important, and how to contribute new tests using a standardized template.

## 🧐 What is a test
A test is a automated programm that check if the code does what it expect do to.\
\
The tests in the 2048 Java project verifies the functionality of specific components, such as the GameController, Grid, or game mechanics. Tests are written using Java's testing framework (e.g., JUnit) to ensure the code 
behaves as expected under different scenarios.

## 🚀 Why Are Tests Important?

- **Prevent Bugs**: Catch errors early in development.
- **Ensure Consistency**: Verify the project works as intended after changes.
- **Improve Confidence**: Provide contributors and maintainers with confidence that their changes do not break existing functionality.
- **Encourage Collaboration**: A well-tested codebase is easier for new contributors to understand and modify.

## ⚒️ How to make a test
In the ‘Template’ repository, there is a template that explains how to write a test in this project. It can be found at this link [Test_template]([templatetest](https://github.com/INFOM126-Automated-Software-Engineering/2048-groupe-07/blob/main/template/Test_template.md)).
