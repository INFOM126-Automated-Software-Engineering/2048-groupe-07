## 🧑‍🏫 Rules
The goal of 2048 is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

Move the Tiles:
  1. You can slide the tiles up, down, left, or right.
  2. All tiles move in the chosen direction until they collide with another tile or the edge of the grid.

Combine Tiles:
  1. When two tiles with the same number collide during a move, they merge into a single tile with a value equal to the sum of the two tiles.
  2. The resulting tile cannot merge again during the same move.

New Tile Appears:
  1. After each move, a new tile (either 2 or 4) randomly appears on an empty spot on the grid.

You win the game if you create a tile with the number 2048.
The game ends when there are no empty spaces on the grid, and no valid moves are possible.
